# CP-starter-code
A repository for common algs and DS for competitive programming.

Time and memory complexities are labelled.
The repository is a collection of algs and DS for CP which are either hard to remember, or easy for one to make a mistake (e.g. off-by-1 errors).

Written in C++ 17. Do not compile on Clang C++, as some functions will not work on Clang (e.g. #include <bits/stdc++.h>)
